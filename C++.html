	    	<p class=que>Why we learn C++?</p>
		<p> 
		It depends. What do you need? Do you work in a company that uses C++? Do you work in an industry where C++ is prevalent? Do you plan to work in such a place? Are you a programmer? Do you want to do programming?

The vast majority of people on this planet do not learn C++, and they manage to live quite well despite it. Most people don't learn any programming language. They don't need it.

Do you need it? If so, learn it. Do you want to learn it? If so, learn it.

		<p class=que>Why OOPs (Features / Advantages)</p>
		1. Inheritance:Through inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.<br>
		-- We can built programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another rather than, having to start writing the code from scratch. This leads to saving of development time and higher productivity.<br>
		-- it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods; 
		--It is easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.<br>
		2. Data Hiding: The programmer can hide the data and functions in a class from other classes. It helps the programmer to build the secure programs.<br>
		3. encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.

		<p class=que>What is Algorithm?</p>
		Each task consists of well-defined procedures known as algorithms. 
		<p class=que>What is pseudo code?</p>
		Pseudocode (pronounced SOO-doh-kohd) is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language.<br>
		Or we can defiene like Pseudocode is a simple way of writing programming code in English. Pseudocode is not actual programming language. It uses short phrases to write code for programs before you actually create it in a specific language. Once you know what the program is about and how it will function, then you can use pseudocode to create statements to achieve the required results for your program.<br>
		The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code, and that it is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks and scientific publications that are documenting various algorithms, and also in planning of computer program development, for sketching out the structure of the program before the actual coding takes place.
		<p class=que>What is program?</p>
		A  specific set of ordered operations aimed at accomplishing a clear business objective, with details on what work is to be done.
		<p class=que>What is flow chart?</p>
		a graphical representation of a computer program in relation to its sequence of functions
