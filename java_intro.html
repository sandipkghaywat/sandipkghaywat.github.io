		<p>
		    Java is  object oriented Higher level programming language. </p>


			<p class=que id="2">2. History of Java?</p>
			<p>Sun was wanted to see what will be next in computing?<br>
So they assembeled one team named as <b>Green team</b><br>
<u>Motivaion:</u>
Inttial they want to make network of heterogeneous consumer deveces.Theat deveces will be small reliable distributed realtime embedded system.So they decided to make a prototype.<br>
<u>Goals:</u>
Consume less memory,platform independent,multi threading,secure.
INITIATLITY THEY THINK TO USE C++ BUT IT HAS SOME LIMITATION AS WE ALL KNOWS <br>
So new language invented ie. Oak(1991) by James Arthur Goslin in 1995 it renamed as Java.
5 sept. 1992 the green team came with the device ie. *7 (StarSeven) handheld touch screen device.
Then they targeted Cable TV it doesnt work<br>
Then they come toward network, internet.<br>
Before java comes into existance internate moves only satic.<br>
so sun world inavonce browser HotJava HTML+program(applet)=dynamic<br>
its java installed browser and applet are platform independent.<br>
Netscape navigator ship with Java.<br>
Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan.
First Version relesed in 1996</p>

<p class=que id="6">6. Data Types in java of java </p>
Primitive data types are defined by the programming language. ex.int,float,char.etc.<br>
Non-primitive data types are not defined by the programming language, but are instead created by the programmer. They are sometimes called "reference variables," or "object references," since they reference a memory location, which stores the data. In the Java programming language, non-primitive data types are simply called "objects" because they are created, rather than predefined. <br>

<p>Here is a list of keywords in the Java programming language. You cannot use any of the following as identifiers in your programs. The keywords <code>const</code> and <code>goto</code> are reserved, even though they are not currently used. <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>null</code> might seem like keywords, but they are actually literals; you cannot use them as identifiers in your programs.</p>

<p class=que id="9">9. Compilation</p>
Compilation :<br>
Every computer has a fix set of instruction tha it understands.<br>
instuection: it is of instruction. ie. 0s and 1s.It is Machine language or machine code or native code.<br>
 ex. 0110100010101010.<br>
So machine language deficult to understang so compute scientis comeup with Assembly Language which is comapred to eassy, But computer understand only machine language.<br>
Assembly language is known as Low Level Langauage.<br>
ex.Li $t1, 5 ADD $t10, 6 but writing program in Assembly language was still touf.<br>
High Level Languages are then introduced are FORTRAN, C, C++, JAVA, C#.<br>
So the translation from Low / Higher level language to the targeted or Machine level language is called as compilation.



<p class=que id="10">10. Four pillars of oops </p><p>
<b>1. Abstraction:</b>&nbsp;Abstraction is a process of exposing essential feature of an entity
while hiding other irrelevant detail. abstraction reduces code complexity and at the same time it makes your aesthetically pleasant.
Abstraction in java is achieved by using interface and abstract class. Interface give 100% abstraction and abstract class give 0-100% abstraction.</p>
<p><b>2.Encapsulation:</b>&nbsp;Encapsulation is wrappingup of data and code. Like clas is encapsulated.Encapsulation is when you hide your modules internal data and all other implementation details/mechanism
from other modules.
it is also a way of restricting access to certain properties or component. pojo class is the best example of encapsulation.</p>
<p><b>3.Plymorlphism:</b>&nbsp;Poly is the greek word poly means multiple and morphism means forms. Pollymorphism we collectivelly called as multiple forms. In other words i.e one entity which acts different role at different instances we can called as polymorphism.<br>
There are two types: <br>
i)Method overloading ii) operator overloading iii) constructor overloading<br>
2) Method overriding:It is also known as late binding, Run Time Polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism.</p>

<td>The parent class have the method But if the child clas is not satisfied with that implimantation then child will redefine the method and that "Redefining the parent class method called method overridding." Method name, argument type and signature, return type must be same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Method Overloading, Constructure Overloading, and Operator Overloading</td><td>Abstract class, Interface</td></tr>

<p><b>4.Inheritance:</b>&nbsp; Inheritance is the process of extending the properties of super class or parent class by the sub class or child class is called as inheritance. <br> 
There are basically two types of inheritance in java 1) Single 2) MUltiple <br>
<b><u>Note:</b></u>&nbsp;Java does not support Multiple Inheritance bcoz it creates confussion to access the properties of parent class.Instead java supports Interface in java.</p>

<p class=que id="11">11. Setting up the path for windows machine.(Permenant)</p>

Assuming you have installed Java in c:\java\jdk directory:<br>
- Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.<br>
- Click on the 'Environment variables' button under the 'Advanced' tab.<br>
- Now alter the 'Path' variable so that it also contains the path to the Java executable. Example, if the path is currently set to 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32', then change your path to read 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32;c:\java\jdk\bin'.<br>
We can set path temporary base on Command promt like type
set path= "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_73\bin"


	<p class=que id="12">12. Boxing and Unboxing. </p>
	<p>Wrapper class in java proviede the mechanism to convert primitie into onject and object into promitive. The process of converting Primitive into Object is called as Autoboxing and Object into Primitive is called Unboxing.</p>
		
		
		
		<p class=que id="13">13. Why java is WORA. </p>
		<p>WORA means Write Once Run Anywhere:Java is Compiled and Interpreted language.Once it Compile it creates a bytecode ie .class file. Various platform might vary in fonfiguration, those they would all understand the same set of Bytecode, thereby making the java program platform independent java achives WORA.</p>
		<p class=que id="14">14. What is JDK, JRE, JVM </p>
		JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit.It physically exists.It contains JRE + development tools.<br>
		JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.It is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation of JVM.It physically exists.It contains set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
Implementation of JVMs are also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems.<br>
VM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE and JDK are platform dependent because configuration of each OS differs. But, Java is platform independent.
The JVM performs following main tasks:<br>
1. Loads code<br>
2. Verifies code<br>
3. Executes code<br>
4. Provides runtime environment
		<p class=que id="15">15. What are the differences between a compiler, an interpreter and an assembler?</p>
		<p>Compiler converts source code to some kind of intermediate form. For static language, a compiler usually converts the source code to assembly, which usually did not get stored to disk, then the assembler is invoked to convert the assembly to binary code, which is usually stored as object file(.o or .obj suffix usually), then linker is invoked to link object file(s) to binary executable. Also it is common to refer to this whole process of compiling, assembling, linking as compiling. So you may call gcc a compiler, but it actually invokes cc1 which is the compiler to compile, as which is the assembler to assemble, ld which is the linker to link. </p>
<p>
 For language which has a intermediate so called bytecode form, the source code is first converted to byte code, this process can be called compiling, javac serves as an example. Bytecode cannot be run on host machines, it needs a program, which is actually the process from the viewpoint of OS, to interpret the bytecode to the host machine, this program is called a interpreter, think of java. Some language, like python, do the compiling and interpreting work with a single command</p>
		<p class=que id="16">16. What is Class Loader and thier types</p>
		<p>The Java Classloader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine. Usually classes are only loaded on demand. The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders.
			1.Bootstrap Class Loader<br>
			2. Extension Class Loader<br>
			3. Application Class Loader</p>
			Note:These clas loader follws the deligation hirarchy meachanism in java. There prioritya of executution is from top to bottom.
		<p class=que id="17">17. What is JIT Compiler</p>
		In the Java programming language and environment, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler is a program that turns Java bytecode (a program that contains instructions that must be interpreted) into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.
		<p class=que id="18">18. Which are memory area in JVM</p>
		<p>Basically there are five types of memory area in JVM.<br>
		<b>1.Method Area:</b>&nbsp; This is the class area the binary data of class resides here. String constant pool area resides here. Its default size is 64 MB till the JDK 1.7 from JDK 1.8 its increases to unlimited size.This area is loaded once per JVM.<br>
		<b>2. Heap Area:</b>&nbsp;Its area for objects, Class class object and instance variable data, Arrays are allocated in this area.This area is loaded once per JVM.<br>
		<b>3. Stack Area:</b>&nbsp;It keep track for current executing method and its data. Its created one per thread.<br><b>4. Program Counter Register area:</b>&nbsp;Which instruction will execute the next PC register keep track of it.<br><b>5. Native Method Area:</b>&nbsp; This is the area for the such library files which are not incoded in java rather it in other native languages like C or C++.

		<p class=que id="19">19. Explain main method</p>
		This is necessary since main() is called by the Java interpreter before any objects are made. The keyword void simply tells the compiler that main() does not return a value. The true entry point to any application is a static method.
		<p class=que id="20">20. Explain System.out.println();</p>
		System is the class which is in java.lang package and which is only by default accecible package. <br>
    -Out is the static variable of printStream type.<br>
    -println() is the method which is present in printStream class
        <p class=que id="21">21. Rules for declaring the variables.</p>

<p>Path variable is set for provide path for all java tools like java, javac, javap, javah, jar, appletviewer. In Java for run any program we use java tool and for compile java code use javac tool. These all tools are available in bin folder so we set path upto bin folder.

classpath

classpath variable is set for provide path of all java classes which is used in our application. All classes are available in lib/rt.jar so we set classpath upto lib/rt.jar.</p>

        <p class=que id="24">24. What id marker Interface and Annnotation</p> Marker interface means blank interface in other words the interface which doesnt contain any method. implementing it is meant to imply some special treatment of the implementing class.e.g. Serializable, Clonnable and Remote<br>
        <u>Annotations are better than Marker Interfaces</u><br>
        - Since jdk 1.5 we can use annotation instead of marker interface.
        -Java Annotation is a tag that represents the metadata i.e. attached with class, interface, methods or fields to indicate some additional information which can be used by java compiler and JVM.

Annotations in java are used to provide additional information, so it is an alternative option for XML and java marker interfaces.
        <p class=que id="25">25. What is the difference between the data types of java and C++</p>
 		1. Data types in java are strictly typedef.<br>
 		2. The language standard was developed i.e. Unicode System.<br>
3.In unicode, character holds 2 byte, so java also uses 2 byte for characters. and lowest value:\u0000 highest value:\uFFFF<br>
3. The data types are 2 byes and are guarented as per their types they are sure signed or Unsigned.
ex.char is guarenged to be signed.
		<p class=que id="26">26. Call Byreference Vs Call Byvalue</p>
    There is only call by value in java, not call by reference. If we call a method passing a value, it is known as call by value. The changes being done in the called method, is not affected in the calling method.
		<p class=que id="27">27. final keyword in java?</p>
		Variable: It will be like a constanat.<br>
		Method: We can inherit the final method but cannot override it.<br>
		Blank final variable: we can initialize the blank fina vaariable by the constructor only.<br>
		Static final variable: we can initalize it in static block only.<br>
		fianl argument: We can not change once it declared that argument final.<br>
		Constructor: We cannot declare constructor as final because we cannot inherited it.

		Class: We cannot inherit the final class

		<p class=que id="29">29. Deep Cloning Vs Shalow Clonning</p>
		Object Cloning in Java. The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object.<br>
		A shallow copy can be made by simply copying the reference.<br>
		This can lead to unpleasant side effects if the elements of values are changed via some other reference.<br>
		A deep copy means actually creating a new array and copying over the values.

		<p class=que id="30">30. Object Lock Vs Class Lock</p>
		Object level locking is mechanism when you want to synchronize a non-static method or non-static code block such that only one thread will be able to execute the code block on given instance of the class.<br>
		Class level locking prevents multiple threads to enter in synchronized block in any of all available instances on runtime. This means if in runtime there are 100 instances of  DemoClass, then only one thread will be able to execute demoMethod() in any one of instance at a time, and all other instances will be locked for other threads. This should always be done to make static data thread safe.
		<p class=que id="31">31. Fully checked Vs Partically Checked.</p>
		Checked exception said to be fully checked if and only if all its child classes are checked IOException, InterpretedException, RuntimeException, ServletException.<br>
		a checked exception is said to be partially checked if and only if some of its child classes are un-checked<br>Exception, Throwable.
		
		<p class=que id="32">32. Function Vs Method</p>
    A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (ie. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value).

All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

A method is a piece of code that is called by name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences.

It is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
It is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).
		<p class=que id="33">33. Composition IS-A Vs Aggregation HAS-A</p>
    <b>Association</b> <br>

Association is a relationship between two objects. In other words, association defines the multiplicity between objects. You may be aware of one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many all these words define an association between objects. Aggregation is a special form of association. Composition is a special form of aggregation.<br>



Example: A Student and a Faculty are having an association.<br>

<b>Aggregation</b><br>

Aggregation is a special case of association. A directional association between objects. When an object ‘has-a’ another object, then you have got an aggregation between them. Direction between them specified which object contains the other object. Aggregation is also called a “Has-a” relationship.<br>



<b>Composition</b><br>

Composition is a special case of aggregation. In a more specific manner, a restricted aggregation is called composition. When an object contains the other object, if the contained object cannot exist without the existence of container object, then it is called composition.<br>
Example: A class contains students. A student cannot exist without a class. There exists composition between class and students.


		<p class=que id="34">34. Static keyword</p>
    <b>Variable</b><br>
    When a variable is declared with the keyword “static”, its called a “class variable”. All instances share the same copy of the variable. A class variable can be accessed directly with the class, without the need to create a instance.<br>
    It is a variable which belongs to the class and not to object(instance)<br>
Static variables are initialized only once , at the start of the execution . These variables will be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables<br>
A single copy to be shared by all instances of the class<br>
A static variable can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object<br>
Syntax : <class-name>.<variable-name><br>
<b>static method</b><br>

It is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object(instance)<br>
A static method can access only static data. It can not access non-static data (instance variables)<br>
A static method can call only other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it.<br>
A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object<br>
Syntax : <class-name>.<method-name><br>
A static method cannot refer to “this” or “super” keywords in anyway<br>
<b>static block</b><br>

The static block, is a block of statement inside a Java class that will be executed when a class is first loaded in to the JVM.

    <p class=que id="65">65. Here are a few more of the most important “omissions” from C++</p>
    :

<br>- Java does not include structures or unions. These were felt to be redundant

since the class encompasses them.

<br>- Java does not support operator overloading. Operator overloading is sometimes

a source of ambiguity in a C++ program, and the Java design team felt that it

causes more trouble than benefit.

<br>- Java does not include a preprocessor nor does it support the preprocessor

directives. The preprocessor plays a less important role in C++ than it does

in C. The designers of Java felt that it was time to eliminate it entirely.

<br>- Java does not perform any automatic type conversions that result in a loss of

precision. For example, a conversion from long integer to integer must be

explicitly cast.

<br>- All the code in a Java program is encapsulated within one or more classes.

Therefore, Java does not have what you normally think of as global variables

or global functions.

<br>- Java does not allow default arguments. In C++, you may specify a value

that a parameter will have when there is no argument corresponding to

that parameter when the function is invoked. This is not allowed in Java.

<br>- Java does not support the inheritance of multiple superclasses by a subclass.

<br>- Although Java supports constructors, it does not have destructors. It does,

however, add the finalize( ) function.

<br>- Java does not support typedef.

<br>- It is not possible to declare unsigned integers in Java.

<br>- Java does not allow the goto.

<br>- Java does not have the delete operator.

<br>- The << and >> in Java are not overloaded for I/O operations.

<br>- In Java, objects are passed by reference only. In C++, objects may be passed by

value or by reference.
<p class=que id="66">66. what is CAFEBABE or magic code</p>
Following is the explanation given by the father of java James Gosling: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
As far as I know, I´m the guilty party on this one. I was totally unaware of the NeXT connection. The small number of interesting HEX words is probably the source of the match. As for the derivation of the use of CAFEBABE in Java, it´s somewhat circuitous: 

We used to go to lunch at a place called St Michael´s Alley. According to local legend, in the deep dark past, the Grateful Dead used to perform there before they made it big. It was a pretty funky place that was definitely a Grateful Dead Kinda Place. When Jerry died, they even put up a little Buddhist-esque shrine. When we used to go there, we referred to the place as Cafe Dead. 

Somewhere along the line it was noticed that this was a HEX number. I was re-vamping some file format code and needed a couple of magic numbers: one for the persistent object file, and one for classes. I used CAFEDEAD for the object file format, and in grepping for 4 character hex words that fit after CAFE (it seemed to be a good theme) I hit on BABE and decided to use it. 

At that time, it didn´t seem terribly important or destined to go anywhere but the trash-can of history. So CAFEBABE became the class file format, and CAFEDEAD was the persistent object format. But the persistent object facility went away, and along with it went the use of CAFEDEAD - it was eventually replaced by RMI.<br><br>

<p class=que id="67">67. What is recursion.</p>
Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem. A method that uses this technique is recursive. Many programming problems can be solved only by recursion, and some problems that can be solved by other techniques are better solved by recursion.
<p class=que id="68">68. What is deadlock.</p>
Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.
or we can say Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, that is acquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread. Since, both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, the condition is called deadlock.
<p class=que id="69">69. why is hashcode method in java.</p>
<p class=que id="70">70. What is Assertion keyword in java</p>
You can use assertions to detect errors that may otherwise go unnoticed. Assertions contain Boolean expressions that define the correct state of your program at specific points in the program source code. The designers of the Java platform, however, didn't include support for assertions. Perhaps they viewed exceptions as a superior feature, allowing you to use try/ catch/ finally to throw an exception instead of aborting the program as in assertions. But the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) release 1.4, has introduced a built-in assertion facility. <br>
It is mainly used for testing purpose.it's been rarely used specially if you have not writing unit test using JUnit.
<p class=que id="71">71. Can abstract class have a constructor.</p>
Yes, abstract class can declare and define constructor in Java. Since you can not create instance of abstract class,  constructor can only be called during constructor chaining, i.e. when you create instance of concrete implementation class. 

Now some interviewer, ask what is the purpose of constructor, if you can not instantiate abstract class? Well, it can still be used to initialize common variables, which are declared inside abstract class, and used by various implementation. 

Also even if you don’t provide any constructor, compiler will add default no argument constructor in an abstract class, without that your subclass will not compile, since first statement in any constructor implicitly calls super(), default super class constructor in Java.
