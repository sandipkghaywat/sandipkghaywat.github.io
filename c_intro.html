	<b>SOFTWARE :</b> As per the industrial standard a digitalized (GUI) automated system is called software.
When the software where is providing graphically user interface then it is called digitalized. Without human interaction if the process if completed then it is called automated System.
A software is nothing but a collection of programs. A program is a set of instruction which is designed for a particular task. A number of program combined together like a single unit it is called software tool or software components.
<br/><b>SOFTWARE ARE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO TYPES :</b><br/>
1. System SOFTWARE<br/>
2. Application SOFTWARE<br/>
<u>1. System software :</u> The software design for general purpose & does not having any limitation it is called system software.
System software area classified into three types:<br/>
i) OS : Dos, Windows, Linux, Unix<br/>
ii) Translators : Compiler, Interpreter, Assemblers<br/>
iii) Packages : Linker, Loader, Editor.<br/>
<u>2. Application SOFTWARE :</u> This is software is design for specific task only it is called application software.<br/> Ex. application software are classified into two types i.e a) Application packages - Ex. MS-Office, Oracle b) Specific purpose software - Ex. Tally.<br/><br/>
<b>Computer</b> is an electronic device which accept instruction from user and according to user sended instruction it produces result. Computer knows only one language i.e Binary language.<br/>
As a programmer when wer required to interact witha computer we need a communication channel called programming langurges. A programming language is a special kind of instructions which is used to communicate with computer. As a programmer if we knows the programming languges then it is not possible to interact with computer because computer can understand binary code only. In such case, recommended to use translators. As a programmes if the instruction come programming language, translator will convert that programming language code into binary format and according to even binary instructions we will be an application or software.<br/><br/>
<b>Translators :</b> A translator is a system software which converts programming language code into binary format.<br/>
Translators are classified into three types.<br/>1. Compiler <br/>2. Interpreter <br/>3. Assembler <br/><b>1. Compiler :</b> It is a system software which converts programming language code into binary format in a single step except those lines are having error.<br/> <b>2. Interpreter :</b> It is a system software which converts programming language code into binary format step by step. i.e line by line compilation takes place. (When first error is occur it stop compilation process).<br/> <b>3. Assembler :</b> By using assembler we can convert assembly language instructions into binary formats. As per the performance wise, recommended to use comiler. As per the development wise recommended to use an interpreter.<br/><br/> <b>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</b> <br/> A programming language is a special kind of instrunctions which is used to communicate with computer. Programming language is classified into two types <br/> 1. Hign level programming languages <br/> 2. Low level programming language. <br/> <b>1. HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</b><br/>The programming languate which is syntactically similar to english and easy to understand it is called high level programming langguage. By using high level programming language we are developing user intgerface application. Ex. C, C++, Java, C# etc.<br/> <b>2. LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</b><br/>This programming language is called assembly language.</p>

		<p class=que>Introduction of C</p>
		<p>

C is a general-purpose language which has been closely associated with the UNIX operating system for which it was developed - since the system and most of the programs that run it are written in C.<br>

Many of the important ideas of C stem from the language <b>BCPL, developed by Martin Richards.</b> The influence of BCPL on C proceeded indirectly through <b>the language B, which was written by Ken Thompson in 1970 at Bell Labs,</b> for the first UNIX system on a DEC PDP-7. <u>BCPL and B are "type less" languages whereas C provides a variety of data types.</u><br>

In 1972 Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs writes C and in 1978 the publication of The C Programming Language by Kernighan & Ritchie caused a revolution in the computing world.<br>

In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or "ANSI C", was completed late 1988.</p>
